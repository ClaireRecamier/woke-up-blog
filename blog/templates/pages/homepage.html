      <h2>What Is Woke Up?</h2>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Woke Up is a platform for teenagers and young adults to have discussions about social issues.
Topics addressed include cultural appropriation, racism, gender inequality, etc. We will not tolerate irrelevant or hateful comments and posts. If disagreements arise, you are encouraged to voice your opinion, as long as you do so respectfully. We hope you enjoy. Stay Woke!</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">We support discussions regarding relevant topics with posts and want to be able to educate our generation about different kinds of conversations that allow respect and acceptance. There are different resources available that are directed to other issues such as the vent section and a cultural appropriation survey. Vent is a platform that allows you to publicly post problems and situations that might be troubling you. The post will automatically delete within 48 hours and is anonymous. This is aimed to help those relieve their stress by having an outlet to release anything that is bothering them without having to worry about it coming back or having their name traced. More information is found on the individual page. Our cultural appropriation survey is an informative survey that takes gender and race and gives examples of culture being appropriated and an explanation on the background. Our resources also include websites that we believe are helpful, books, movies and TV shows we enjoy and wish to share with you! Thank you so much for visiting, enjoy Woke Up!

          <h5> Woke Up is founded by four girls who are passionate about educating their generation about social issues. They hope this platform will benefit their society and help young adults eventually become comfortable discussing and bringing awareness to these topics in public.</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            Cameron is a rising senior in high school in Long Island. Cameron wanted a place where teens could talk about different things like social issues or just a place to talk about different things, but be anonymous. Being anonymous helps the person in many ways. Now that person doesn't have to be scared to say different things, worried about being judged or even known as the person who said what they said. She feels this will help teens get things off their chest and relieve some stress. <br>
          Claire is a rising high school senior in Manhattan. <br>
          Elaine hopes that Woke Up will allow an outlet for teenagers to share their opinions and become more aware and accepting of otherâ€™s opinions. She wants teenagers to have discussions without being afraid of backlash. She thanks you for visiting Woke Up and hopes that you will join our community! <br>
          Zoe is a 17 year old, native New Yorker who has a passion for activism,coding, and sports. Zoe hopes that this website provides a safe space for young adults to talk and learn about social issues. She is excited for the future of Woke Up and wants to thank everyone for stopping by!
